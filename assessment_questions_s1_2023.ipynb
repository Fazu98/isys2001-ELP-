        "1. Command-Line Arguments: Instead of interactive inputs, the program could take command-line arguments for the file path and the analysis option. This would make the program easier to use in automated scripts.\n",
        "2. Caching Results: If the user requests the same analysis multiple times, the program could cache the results so it doesn't have to recalculate them.\n",
        "3. Better Text Normalization: Currently, the program considers 'Word' and 'word' as two different words because of the case difference. Better text normalization could handle such situations, as well as punctuation, hyphens, etc.\n",
        "4. Support for Large Files: For very large files, the current approach of reading the entire file into memory might be inefficient or even impossible. The program could be redesigned to handle large files by processing them in chunks.\n",
        "5. Support for Different File Types: Currently, the program only supports text files. It could be extended to handle other types of files, such as binary files or specific formats like CSV, JSON, or XML.\n",
        "6. Logging: Adding logging to the program would be useful for tracking its execution, particularly if something goes wrong. Python's built-in logging module could be used for this.\n",
        "Progress Feedback: For large files or slow operations, it would be helpful to provide feedback to the user about the progress of the operation.\n",
        "7. Modular Programming or OOP: The program could benefit from a more structured approach such as modular programming or object-oriented programming, which would make the code easier to read, maintain, and extend. You could create classes for different types of analysis and use inheritance for common features.\n",

The program informs the user of the issue and returns, without crashing.\n",
